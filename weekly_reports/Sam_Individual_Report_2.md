### *Include screenshots/diagrams/figures/etc. to illustrate what you did this past week.*

### **What problems did you run into? What is your plan for them?**

I ran into problems getting the models to the correct supported format of three js. I found a repo with python scripts to convert them from the same people making opensim.

### **What is the current overall project status from your perspective?**

The project looks to be about 50% done at this point. I think we are making great progress.

### **How is your team functioning from your perspective?**

I think our team is working well together.

### **What new ideas did you have or skills did you develop this week?**

I learned how to create a model and a 3d scene in three js, as well as how to convert our opensim models into a more open file type like gltf.

### **Who was your most awesome team member this week and why?**

I think I was the most awesome team member because rendering a skeleton on the website is cooler than having a working testing suite.

## **Plans for Next Week**

I plan to build an animation pipeline to make sure we can properly animate the model with collected data.
