### **What did *you* work on this past week?**

| Task | Status | Time Spent |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Docker Container for Converting Files is Hosted on Azure | Done | 10 hours |

*Include screenshots/diagrams/figures/etc. to illustrate what you did this past week.*

### **What problems did you run into? What is your plan for them?**

I ran into issues getting the docker container hosted because it was 25GB, so I had to decrease the size of the images by getting rid of unneeded files on the container. I also had issues because I was building the docker container on my mac which makes an arm64 image, but most hosting sites including azure require amd64, so the image had to be rebuilt for amd64 which takes like 3 hours. Everything is solved now though.

### **What is the current overall project status from your perspective?**

We are basically done with the project, just some minor adjustments need to be made in the next couple days.

### **How is your team functioning from your perspective?**

I think our team has been successful.

### **What new ideas did you have or skills did you develop this week?**

I learned a lot about how docker works and how deploying containers can be frustrating.

### **Who was your most awesome team member this week and why?**

I think I was the most awesome team member this week for spending so much time debugging the docker container and getting it running, I learned a lot about the struggles of using docker and azure.

## **Plans for Next Week**

Documentation and user studies.
