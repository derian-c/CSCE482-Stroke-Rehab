# **Team Weekly Report**

Team: LIVE: Stroke Rehab  
Week: 9  
Members: Alex Mayer, Derian Compean, Brandon Fornero, Sam Trythall

## **Status Report**

Progress has been somewhat slow due to the break, but we are back in action and ready to make some big pushes in our development. The IMU system that we will use to collect motion data has been assembled, and though it will need some tuning before we are fully ready to test it, the hardware component of our project is nearing completion. Our software focused tasks are also being worked on, including implementing Vitest in the frontend and updating our backend schema with numerous functions. With our skeletal model introduced into the physician view, we are also looking into ways to smoothly display its animations as well as creating a pipeline to integrate the model with OpenSim.   
We will be working on numerous features in the coming week, including implementing messaging functionality in the front and back end, managing the data files recorded by our test IMU system, adding accessibility options, and fixing role based access control for our routes.
