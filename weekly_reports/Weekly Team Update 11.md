# **Team Weekly Report**

Team: LIVE: Stroke Rehab  
Week: 11  
Members: Alex Mayer, Derian Compean, Brandon Fornero, Sam Trythall

## **Status Report**

This last week our group made significant changes to the frontend and backend, integrating the crud operations to work properly with the database, and supported by the frontend. The model was also animated and is currently displayed on the website. We also protected our routes using proper react routing instead of checking roles in functions on the pages. Accessibility tools were added to the website this last week as well. For this next week our team plans to finish up the pipeline for getting the animations hooked up to the blob storage database using backend routing, refactoring some of the backend functions and database tables, and optimizing some of the pages to not load slowly.
