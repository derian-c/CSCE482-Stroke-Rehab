# **Team Weekly Report**

Team: LIVE: Stroke Rehab  
Week: 12  
Members: Alex Mayer, Derian Compean, Brandon Fornero, Sam Trythall

## **Status Report**

This past week was somewhat hectic, as we had a lot of additional work to complete before the sprint 4 status demo. Despite this, many of the features we were working on we were able to implement; for instance, the document viewer on the patient end is functional, and patients are now able to upload documents relating to their medical and exercise records as well as view them. We also developed a separate docker server to convert the motion files recorded from the IMU device into glb files that will then display the patient animations in the physician view. The medications tab, ability for physicians to add patients to their tab, and motion file upload functionality to the backend were also implemented and work as expected. We also used the week to do various bug fixes, and ensure that the flow of navigating the app was consistent with no room for user error.
