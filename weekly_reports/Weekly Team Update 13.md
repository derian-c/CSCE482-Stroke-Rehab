# **Team Weekly Report**

Team: LIVE: Stroke Rehab  
Week: 13  
Members: Alex Mayer, Derian Compean, Brandon Fornero, Sam Trythall

## **Status Report**

We are finally nearing the end of our project’s development, as well as wrapping up our user studies. There has been a lot of miscellaneous work to complete in this past week, most of it related to small tweaks as a result of user feedback. Some adjustments have been made to the frontend to benefit the page clarity, including tweaked text colors and improved settings options. We have also integrated the file conversion server into our system, so the flow for converting the motion files recorded by the IMU system into the animation displayed on the frontend is complete. Finally, we worked on creating a presentable poster for our project, and are satisfied with the current iteration. We hope that our upcoming presentations will be eventful and that onlookers will be interested in what we’ve worked so hard to accomplish.

| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Dr. Hodics | Stated that the skeletal model accompanied by precise joint angle measurements could provide invaluable data to physicians and physical therapists, especially in cases where other forms of motion tracking fail.   | Adjust some frontend features to better meet the needs of physicians and physical therapists, especially adding a subsection in the documents tab to store specific exercise instructions. |

We have all the resources we need for now.
