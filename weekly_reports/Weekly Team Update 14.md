# **Team Weekly Report**

Team: LIVE: Stroke Rehab  
Week: 14  
Members: Alex Mayer, Derian Compean, Brandon Fornero, Sam Trythall

## **Status Report**

We have reached the end stage of our projectâ€™s development. In the next few days development will be finalized and any remaining user studies will be conducted. There is some documentation that will be cleaned up a bit to better represent the final state of our project. Our EPS poster is also going through the last stages of revision before the event, and all team members are preparing diligently for the presentations. We hope our solution helps stroke patients and their physicians through the arduous process of stroke rehabilitation.
