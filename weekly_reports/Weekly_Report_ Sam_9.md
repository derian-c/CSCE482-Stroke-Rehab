## **Current Status**

### **What did *you* work on this past week?**

| Task  | Status | Time Spent |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Researched ways to hook up animations from opensim to our web application. | Completed | 3 hours |

*Include screenshots/diagrams/figures/etc. to illustrate what you did this past week.*

### **What problems did you run into? What is your plan for them?**

I was a bit worried about having to use anaconda for the opensim python packages, but there is a manual install we can use for our app, so that is no longer an issue. I also think adding the gltf converter for opensim to our project may be a bit weird to do as it is not our code, and adding it to the repo seems weird.  
**What is the current overall project status from your perspective?**  
I think we are about 60% done with the project.

### **How is your team functioning from your perspective?**

I think our team is doing just fine.

### **What new ideas did you have or skills did you develop this week?**

I thought about different methods to read the files without downloading the file from the azure buckets, although I’m not sure how feasible they are. I’ve also thought about how we could implement some role based access actions to automatically trigger upon account creation.

### **Who was your most awesome team member this week and why?**

Brandon for building the hardware portion of the imu setup.

## **Plans for Next Week**

Work on the role based access control, allowing for basic crud operations and get animations working on the frontend.
